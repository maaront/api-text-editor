# JATE - Just Another Text Editor

## Description
JATE is a browser-based text editor built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It serves as a reliable, fast, and engaging tool to create, edit, and save text documents directly in your browser. With its offline functionality and various data persistence techniques, it offers a seamless experience for users. JATE uses JavaScript for client-side logic, the idb package for IndexedDB interaction, and CodeMirror for the text editor view.
